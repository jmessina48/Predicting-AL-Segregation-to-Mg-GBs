# Predicting-AL-Segregation-to-Mg-GBs\
In this file we use machine learning methods to predict atomistically calculated segregation energies of substiutional aluminum atoms placed near 30 different magnesium symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs). <br><br>
The Python Jupyter Notebook code of the final models has been uploaded to this site as well as the code and outputs in HTML form in case that is easier for viewing purposes (right click then press "save file as" to download then view HTML file).  After the hyperparameter tuning was performed using the train-validation-test split (70%-15%-15%) method, a 5 fold cross validation (CV) was used to examine the robustness of each of the models.  The 5 fold CV for each model is also uploaded here. <br><br>
The data file from the atomistic simulations that is used in the machine learning model was greater than 24 MB so couldn't be uploaded to this site.
The data can be provided on request. <br><br>
The machine learning work presented here was conducted primarily by Joseph Messina while a part of the University of Michigan (currently with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) with assistance from Renjie Luo under the supervision of Dr. Fei Gao of the University of Michigan and Dr. Mark Tschopp of the Army Research Laboratory.
