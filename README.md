# Predicting-AL-Segregation-to-Mg-GBs\
In this file we use machine learning methods to predict atomistically calculated segregation energies of substiutional aluminum atom placed near 30 different magnesium symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs).\
The Python Jupyter Notebook code has been uploaded to this site as well as the code and outputs in HTML form for viewing ease.
The data file from the atomistic simulations that are used in the machine learning model was greater than 24 MB so couldn't be uploaded to this site.
The data can be provided on request via email.
